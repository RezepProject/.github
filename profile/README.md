### Short Desprition
Herbert is the digital concierge service. He uses ChatGPT and Mistral AI to best answer users' questions. The backend runs on ASP.NET, we have Postgress as our database and our frontend uses Tree.js. We also have a Blazor based configuration tool that allows you to choose which AI is used to answer the questions. You can also enter hotel-specific questions in the tool, which the frontend then uses to provide the user with hotel-specific answers, such as the position of the nearest toilet.

### Future
Herbert will enter a test phase in Q1 2025 in a hotel belonging to the SchwarzenbÃ¤ren Hotel Group. 

### Goal

Herbert's aim is to counteract the continuing shortage of staff in tourism and also to make the guests' stay more enjoyable and easier
